      <h2>Bitcoin Hits New All-Time High</h2>
      <p> The price of bitcoin hit a new peak and erased a day's worth of losses within minutes Wednesday morning after the Bureau of Labor Statistics revealed U.S. consumer prices grew at the quickest pace in more than 30 years last month, fueling the inflationary fears that have lifted cryptocurrencies to meteoric new highs during the pandemic. </p>

      <h2>Ethereum 2.0 Upgrade Announced</h2>
      <p>The launch date for ETH 2.0, which was originally planned for 2019, will now likely take place between 10 and 20 September 2022 (however the current estimate shows the potential date as 14 September), the Ethereum Foundation has announced. It had previously been pegged to either 15 or 16 September following the success of the Goerli Testnet merge, which is the third and final testnet merge before the official Merge of the Ethereum mainnet. The Bellatrix hard fork, the latest upgrade before the move to PoS, has been activated on 6 September, 2022.ETH 2.0, now known as the ‘consensus layer’, will see the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency move from the energy-hungry proof-of-work (PoW) consensus mechanism to the leaner, greener proof-of-stake (PoS) system.The Ethereum organisation says the upgrade will make the crypto “more scalable, more secure and more sustainable,” and that the changes are being implemented by teams “from across the Ethereum ecosystem”.</p>

      <h2>Litecoin Introduces Privacy Features</h2>
      <p>Privacy and anonymity are one of the core features of the blockchain and cryptocurrency space. It is, however, also one of the least favorite features of the blockchain space among regulatory bodies worldwide. So, it comes as little surprise that Litecoin’s (LTC) move meets with a lot of regulatory compliance issues and the subsequent delistings.

The recently introduced privacy protocol, also known as the MimbleWimble (MWEB) upgrade, was first designed in November 2019. The upgrade will provide complete anonymity between transacting parties on the Litecoin network. Also, the successful approval of the upgrade resulted in incorporating Litecoin’s MWEB at a block height of 2,257,920. Therefore, resulting in the introduction of privacy features in the Litecoin network.</p>

      <h2>Cardano Surpasses Market Expectations</h2>
      <p>Cardano (ADA) needs no introduction in the cryptocurrency world. As one of the prime 'Ethereum Killers', it's often considered one of the best altcoins. Are you considering investing in Cardano? Our Cardano price prediction guide will be helpful in many ways.
      Based on forecasts from over 18 industry experts, Cardano native token (ADA) will continue to rise in the months and years to come. In the next couple of years, the median price target is $2.52 while a high estimate of $3 and a low estimate of $1.17. The average price representing a 309% price gain. 

Looking for a brief outlook on Cardano price prediction? Here is a summary of the latest Cardano price forecasts for the years ahead:

End of 2023 — Once the Cardano stock price begins a bull run, it can sustain itself for months. Cryptocurrencies, including Cardano (ADA), are still in the recovery phase after last year's bear market. ADA may perform better than most, but our Cardano price prediction for 2023 shows that ADA will be valued at $0.87 before the current year runs out.
End of 2024 — The cryptocurrency market will be better positioned for a major improvement in 2024. When most issues are properly addressed and ADA picks up momentum, Cardano price prediction may rise to about $2.40 before the end of 2024.</p>

      <h2>Polkadot Launches New Cross-Chain Solutions</h2>
      <p>Blockchain platform Polkadot has launched a new cross-chain communications protocol, saying it will do away with cumbersome bridging mechanisms that have cost the crypto industry billions in cyber attacks. 

The newly launched XCM messaging system is intended to promote Polkadot’s multichain ecosystem, which is being built on the premise of full interoperability. XCM channels are said to be secured at the same level as Polkadot’s central hub, dubbed Relay Chain, and are also available for use by parachains. In other words, XCM will enable communication between parachains themselves as well as smart contracts.

Future iterations of XCM will allow messages to be sent between parachains without having to be stored on the Relay Chain, thereby improving scalability and eliminating governance processes for individual chains.

Bridge hacks have cost the cryptocurrency industry more than $1 billion over the past year, underscoring major security vulnerabilities of the new technology, according to data compiled by Chainalysis and reported by Bloomberg. Axie Infinity’s Ronin bridge exploit was perhaps the most infamous attack, with the perpetrators draining more than $600 million worth of digital assets in just two transactions.</p>

      <h2>Bitcoin Cash Implements Smart Contract Functionality</h2>

In this article:

BCH-USD
-0.01%

Last weekend, Richard Heart and Roger Ver had a really interesting conversation about Bitcoin Cash and the overall state of cryptocurrency.

Much to my interest, Tai Zen, a crypto trader that I personally follow, also released a brand new interview with Mr Ver. They discussed how Bitcoin Cash works compared to Bitcoin and new features the project is implementing.

The two interviews are worth a watch if you want to learn a thing or two about how Bitcoin “used to be”, how the space has grown, and some hurdles crypto still needs to overcome to achieve major adoption.

You may also want to check out my interview with Roger Ver during Q1 2019, where we talked about the early days of Bitcoin, how adoption is being furthered, and the impact smart contracts will have on the Bitcoin Cash ecosystem.

My goal today is to discuss how Bitcoin Cash is evolving. I will aim to go in-depth on the two most important features BCH is currently implementing: smart contract functionality and privacy through non-optional coin mixing.</p>

      <h2>Stellar Introduces Decentralized Exchange Protocol</h2>
      <p>The DeFi movement has exploded in the last few years with ICOs and startups, like Stellar (XLM) and Axie Infinity (AXS), raising tens of millions of dollars to build out their protocols that support the creation of decentralized loans and tokens. One DeFi protocol has seen massive attention due to the immense potential of its project.

      <h2>Ethereum Is Chasing the Bull Amid Market Uncertainty, Data Shows</h2>
      <p>While ethereum (ETH) is navigating a precarious balance between bearish uncertainty and bullish prospects, let’s dissect the intricate journey of this altcoin. 

As the digital sun sets over the crypto markets, ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, endures in the face of testing times. With an indecisive path and an apparent lack of a dominating force dictating the market’s future trend, digital assets are sailing in uncharted waters. 

However, charts suggest a pattern that could give traders an insight: an ascending triangle is brewing, offering a glimmer of hope for a bullish turnaround.</p>
